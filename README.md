# Move the Chains (MTC) Football

Move the Chains is a web-based (American) football simulation game built with Python, Django, Bootstrap and vanilla JS.

Although it's semi-playable in its current state, a lot of work still needs to be done before a production version can be released.

Currently, you can simulate full seasons but the game results are based on a random coin flip. Game statistics and management functions like trading or free agent signing have also yet to be added.

In its current state, the game is really just a simple football matchup engine with a schedule, standings, playoffs, teams, and placeholder players.

The reasoning behind this was to make the game functional as quickly as possible. Once the league operations and management portions of the game are built out to a substantial level, then the simulation engine can be improved upon incrementally without sacrificing playability.

# How to Play

There are plans to release a publicly hosted beta version of the game eventually. The management portion of the game still needs some work before that can happen however. A basic simulation engine would be a nice touch as well so the game results aren't so random.

You are welcome to run a version locally to test it out in the meantime. With that said, please don't host your own public version of the code anywhere. Feel free to review the LICENSE.md for more guidelines surrounding this limitation.

CONTRIBUTING.md has details on how to setup a local version of the game for testing purposes.
