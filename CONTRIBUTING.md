# Contributing

To contribute code to the project, please download the CLA-individual.md file (or CLA-entity.md for orgs) in the root of the repository, fill in your details at the bottom, and email the completed document to contact@mtcfootball.com.

This is a necessary step due to the licensing limitations of the software. Please see LICENSE.md for details.

Then fork the project and issue a pull request. You can also create an issue in the issue tracker for discussions about possible features or fixes.

# Installation

The project uses Docker / docker-compose for local development and Pipenv to manage Python dependencies. You will need to install these locally for the most streamlined setup experience. In the future, more flexible ways to spin up a development environment will be added for those who prefer alternative tools.

All you need to do is build the image and start your container.

I will add some more detailed instructions soon. In the meantime, feel free to get in touch if you have any questions or would like to contribute.
