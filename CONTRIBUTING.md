# Contributing

To contribute code to the project, please download the [CLA-individual.md](https://github.com/wjh18/mtc-football/blob/master/CLA-individual.md) file (or [CLA-entity.md](https://github.com/wjh18/mtc-football/blob/master/CLA-entity.md) for orgs) in the root of the repository, fill in your details at the bottom, and email the completed document to [will@wjholmes.com](mailto:will@wjholmes.com).

This is a necessary step due to the licensing limitations of the software. Please see [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/wjh18/mtc-football/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for more details.

Then fork the project, clone your fork, add it as a remote to the upstream repo, make your changes on a new branch, and issue a pull request. You can also create an issue in the issue tracker for discussions about possible feature upgrades or bug fixes.

If you're new to this process, I found [this guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) to be a great resource.

## How to Get Set Up
